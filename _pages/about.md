<p>Hi, my name is Nolan Chai.</p>

![Minimalism]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nolan4.jpg)
*Me in the wild*

<p>I'm a third year undergraduate at UCSD aiming for a triple major in Cognitive Science 
Mathematics-Computer Science, and Linguistics. I like robots, language, how people think and learn, AI, and everything 
in between. I'm still lacking in so many skills and experience, and so I only hope to keep
doing more.</p>

<p>In particular, I enjoy building things with language that people can interact and have fun with.</p>

<p>Outside of academia and all the boring stuff, I am an oil painter and digital artist under the 
pseudonym Kayden, and dabble in strategy and simulation games - such as Rimworld, City Skylines
and also develop games on my own.</p>

<p>You can reach out to me via email or Discord, respectively, at nochai@ucsd.edu and nolan#2483.</p>

<p>Or, if you'd really like, you can reach out to me through the links to my socials at the bottom of the page.</p>
