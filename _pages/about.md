<p>Hi, my name is Nolan Chai.</p>

![Minimalism]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nolan4.jpg)
*Me in the wild*

<p>I'm a third year undergraduate at UCSD aiming for a double major in Cognitive Science and 
Mathematics-Computer Science. I have very broad interests in social robotics, CSE education, 
data science, and HCI, particularly in tasks involving deep learning with topics ranging in, 
but not limited to, computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning,
 and robust control and state optimization of autonomous systems. I have formal experience 
 dealing with data science in the form of bioinformatics, computer vision, and javascript/
web development.</p>

<p>I seek to explore the boundaries between humans and ML/DL technologies, to ultimately find 
ways to build more ethical, interactive, and efficient autonomous systems. Open to any 
opportunities in the Robotics, Autonomous Systems, Bioinformatics, and Applied Machine 
Learning / Data Science fields.</p>

<p>Outside of academia and all the boring stuff, I am an artist under the pseudonym Kayden, 
and dabble in strategy and simulation games - such as Rimworld, as well as develop games 
on my own.</p>
