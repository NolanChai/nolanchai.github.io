description: I've found it especially hard lately to find motivation, but through friends and the people around me, have slowly rediscovered what it means to be 'motivated'.

*HuggingFaceman exists now*

<p>I wasn't able to find housing when I first moved in, straight out of high school, as a sophomore who spent his entire first year and a half online because of COVID. I did nothing, had zero coding experience outside of a few intro lessons, and knew no one from UCSD.</p>

<p>Still, I had that shiny 4.0 and an absurd number of classes I spedrun by taking advantage of asynchronous learning at the time. However, so much was missing from my life. The only friends I knew were the people from sports and clubs in high school. Here, at UCSD, there seemed to be a lack of...something. Something that once pushed me to build, to form communities through clubs, to run and play sports - it was gone for some reason. </p>

<p>I started to sort of ask myself - why did I enjoy all those things? And then, I realized - it's a little cheesy, but the company of friends who were constantly just present in the moment, the electric energy of others motivated around me was what once kept me going. I started looking for people who loved the same things I did - building, creating things, and constantly curious about things around them. It was infectious.</p>

<p>By the end of my first winter quarter as a sophomore, I'd met hundreds of people, whether at UCSD, MIT, or elsewhere, and loved almost every moment of it. However, I entered a sort of state of mania...although I'm a well-known workaholic amongst my friends, it seemed to have transitioned to the form of - drop everything and do whatever excited me.</p>

<p>Earlier this summer, I ended up taking a bit too much to handle - two research positions, an internship, and two part-time jobs simultaneously while taking summer courses. I slowly felt my motivation absolutely disappear as I burned out, and my grades consequently dropped, alongside the first time I'd ever failed a course - my GPA taking a massive 0.7 drop. I stopped talking to anyone for a period of time and slowly toiled away into oblivion as multiple personal issues and drama popped up in the coming months.</p>

<p>However, today, I've somehow found my footing. I met up with a few friends, talked about various situations, and reassessed the reason why I continued to do the things I did. Many of the opportunities I took was due to the fact that they just seemed too wasteful to give up - my research position at MIT, and at NIH. Although people say this a lot, I feel that this time, I've truly learned in the process that every benefit comes with a cost. And to set aside accomplishments to ask myself what everything truly means...to me.</p>

<p>Although I'm basically doomed for grad school at this point, I'll keep struggling to the end, because no matter what - as long as I try my best to learn and do the things I love, I'm content. And there's no point to not trying, right?</p>
